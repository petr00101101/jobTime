Ever wondered how much your team meetings cost? The Meeting Cost Calculator lets you calculate an estimated cost for meetings, using the standard pay rates used by a variety of public sector organizations.

- Data for the core public service is adapted from the TBS Rates of Pay website, and data for the Canadian Armed Forces is adapted from the DND Pay Rates website.
- Meeting costs are determined by converting annual salaries into hourly rates, then multiplying these against the elapsed time. Salary classifications with a range of levels are simplified to minimum, maximum, and median rates, which can be selected under the gear options menu.
